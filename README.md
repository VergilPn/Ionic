# Implement Swiper with Ionic 7
This is a simple image carousel demo created with Ionic and Swiper.js. The program uses the Angular framework to create the basic page structure and services, and leverages the Ionic library to provide UI components and styles.

In addition, the program also uses Swiper.js, a popular JavaScript carousel library that offers various carousel effects and configuration options.

This program is based on the tutorial in this Youtube video by Simon Grimm.<br>
